Kitt Peak 84 inch scripts</br>
The Kitt Peak Electron Multiplying CCD (EMCCD) demonstrator is a new instrument that has been developed for use at the Kitt Peak National Observatory's 84-inch telescope. The immediate goal is to search for rotation period of merged white dwarfs, timing follow-up of short period binaries, as well as short duration transient and periodic sources identified by large field-of-view all-sky surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility. For more details please see the instrument paper: [Coughlin et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04625).

## Data Reduction
The following list steps to reduce photometric data.

### (i) `kp84_setup_reduction.py`
`python kp84_setup_reduction.py --day 20191117`
1. Basic calibration steps: create master bias, dark, and flat frames.<br>
For calibration files done in mode 0, they need to be downsampled by 2x2.<br>
Master bias file is not used, as it is essentially the same as the master dark in mode 0.<br>
Typically, flats are taken with filter sloan _gr_ (or very seldom Johnson _(U)BVRI_).
2. Processing science frames (subtract dark, divide flat).
3. Make register folder; Solve astrometry and save the wcs, using [astrometry.net](http://astrometry.net/).<br>
The wcs in the original fits header is (in good case) off by 1--2 arcmin, and in bad case off by a hemisphere... Is this fixed?!<br>
- Default upload image is the best frame in each cube (the one with most point sources identified). <br>
- If astrometry failed after trying 3 minutes, then stack all images, using the first extension as referencce.<br>
I took the median of un-shifted region, try 5 minutes this time. Shifts between each frames in the multi-extension cubes are also calculated in this step and saved to the registration folder.
- If astrometry still fails using the stacked image, then the object's position (x, y) must be given to the following script, see below.

#### Note
a. There are two ways to call astrometry.net:
- DEFAULT OPTION: Run `solve-field` locally by downloading this software: see the instruction [here](http://astrometry.net/doc/readme.html).
- PREVIOUS VERSION: Query API: Call `kp84_get_wcs.py`.<br>

b. To eliminate the time spent on this step, we should guess the `ra` and `dec` on thee center of the image, and provide the uncertainty of the guess (`radius`). There are two ways to do this:
- DEFAULT `--wcsmode 1`: for each objecct, search for the objName in the `input/observed.dat` file and use the ra and dec there. `radius=0.5 deg`, so please be sure to add this info!
- `--wcsmode 0`: Do not specify the rough coordinate
- `--wcsmode 2`: Trust the wcs in the raw fits file header, `radius=0.5 deg`.

### (ii) `kp84_sextraction.py`
`python kp84_sextraction.py --day 20200105 --objName ZTFJ0538+1953` This runs [Source Extractor](https://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor) to identify point sources.<br>
`python kp84_sextraction.py --day 20200105 --objName ZTFJ0538+1953 --doOnlyPrintPars` This will print the mags and fwhms of all objects found by SExtractor<br>
`sex science.fits -c default.sex -PARAMETERS_NAME daofind.param -FILTER_NAME default.conv -CHECKIMAGE_TYPE BACKGROUND -CHECKIMAGE_NAME science.background.fits -CATALOG_NAME science.cat -MAG_ZEROPOINT 0.0`</br>
See [this page](https://sextractor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Param.html) for columns in the `.cat` file.<br>
All default files are in the `/defualt` directory. 

Note that this step is necessary for the purpose of (1) identify reference star, and (2) enable background subtraction before performing forced photometry. See below.

### (iii) `kp84_photometric_reduction.py`
- When all wcs are successfully found:
`python kp84_photometric_reduction.py --day 20191117 --objName ZTFJ01395245`
- When there are files that astrometry fails (or if you don't want to use the wcs solution found by astrometry.net):
`python kp84_photometric_reduction.py --day 20200105 --objName ZTFJ0538+1953 --xstar 267*256*234*191*134 --ystar 341*341*343*351*353 --xyext 499*86*519*548*84 --xyfile 033949_ZTFJ0538+1953_4_cl_o*033949_ZTFJ0538+1953_4_cl_o_0000*054524_ZTFJ0538+1953_5_cl_o*074541_ZTFJ0538+1953_5_cl_o*084543_ZTFJ0538+1953_5_cl_o_0000 --doOffTune --aper_size 5 --sky_in 10 --sky_out 28 --aper_size_ref 14 --sky_in_ref 15 --sky_out_ref 33 --xoffref 7.23 --yoffref -48 --refmag 14.838 --doSubtractBackground --doSkipRegis --doSkipFindRef --moviemode 10`

#### Steps
1. Find the coordinate of object (from the file `input/observed.dat`). So make sure to add this beforehead.<br>
Then for each file (`kped_20191117_hhmmss_ZTFJ01395245_cl_o*`) that belong to the object, do the following steps:
2. Use the wcs, find the (x, y) of science and reference objects in each frame, save to the processing fits file's headers<br>
Disgard frames where the object shifted outside of the field.<br>
- **If the `xstar`, `ystar`, `xyext`, `xyfile` parameters are provided, the wcs solution will be disgarded**, this is because sometimes the wcs solution can also be a bit off...!
- If the `xoffref`, `yoffref`, and `refmag` parameters are not provided, the reference star is selected based on proximity, brightness, FWHM, and roundness (given by SExtractor).
3. Photometry
- Copy the pre-processed image into output directory, name it as `science.fits`
- Run forced photometry on sci and ref objects using [PythonPhot](https://github.com/djones1040/PythonPhot/blob/master/PythonPhot/aper.py). Currently we only support differential photometry.<br>
The default aperture size is 10 pixels, and the default annulus radius is [30, 50] pixels. <br>
**You may really want to adjust these parameters depending on how crowded the field is.** 
This can be changed by setting the `aper_size`, `sky_inner`, and `sky_outer` parameters (all in the unit of pixels), as well as the `aper_size_ref`, `sky_inner_ref`, and `sky_outer_ref` parameters for the reference star (preferentially a brighter one).<br>
We allow the aperture size for science and reference objects to vary since their FWHM can be quite different.

#### moviemode
If turn on `moviemode!=0`, the script will make a movie of the indivisual frames (arranged by time of observation). 
This can be very helpful if you'd like to examine if the choice of aperture size is appropriate. 
- `moviemode==1`: plot all frames
- `moviemode==10`: plot one frame every 10 frames

Some notes:
This can be hard sometimes due to the limited field of view (4x4 arcmin)
- If too faint, then turn on `--doStack --nimages 5`
